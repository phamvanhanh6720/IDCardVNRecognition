## Update 
* I recently updated the new version that is easy to install and is improved slightly in accuracy and performance.
  But, I only publish source code. If you want to run the demo,  you can clone branch 'version2'.
  
## Install Dependencies
```angular2html
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Server
```angular2html
uvicorn run:app --host='hostname'
```
